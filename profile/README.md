## About "Journeys of Closure"

"Journeys of Closure" is more than a game; it is a digital memorial where users can create lasting tributes to their loved ones. With its captivating Godot-based web interface, this project offers a unique way to celebrate and remember the lives of those who have passed away.

## Key Features (Under Development)

- **(MVP) Creation of Personalized Memories:** Users can register and insert memories into virtual waters adorned with candles. These memories can include descriptions, photos, and essential data about the person's life, such as birth and death dates.

- **Customizable Characters:** Users have the option to customize characters that navigate boats across the waters. These characters represent the users and sail through the peaceful waters.

- **Shared Memories:** Besides creating their own memories, users can view and interact with memories created by others. This fosters a sense of community and connection as people come together to celebrate the lives of many individuals.
